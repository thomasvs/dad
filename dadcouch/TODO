* write caching couchdb server in paisley that
  - caches complete docs parsed into objects by id and class
  - notifies about changes to cached docs
  - notifies about changes to previously returned view results
	(change/add/delete)
* use it to reimplement consistency checking, such that we can reuse the
  methods that look up a file for a track
* dadtest does not have categories, add to script
* dad does not have slices
* add verification that trackscores are unique
* slice-lookup: used by trackloader with wrong params, when it does not have
  track_id; also by getSlices in daddb; so maybe split in two separate views ?
* integrate new mapping into paisley
* release paisley
* find a way to either properly split or merge couchdb dad and other dad
