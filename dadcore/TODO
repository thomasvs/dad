- when seeking to a track, prioritize new track such that only that one plays
- add last.fm support, possibly using python-lastfm, see mixins.async_callback
  which is based on threads, but maybe replacing urllib2 and the decorator
  allows us to do everything with pure-twisted-deferreds
- add error handling; playing a non-existing file just stops the player

- figure out if leveller's do_handle_message leaks messages:
  valgrind --show-reachable=yes --leak-check=full --suppressions=valgrind-python.supp python dad/gstreamer/leveller.py /home/thomas/gst/media/small/south.mp3 

<bilboed-pi> homeasvs_, basically... in your do_handle_message implementation, the given messages should have a refcount of 1

DEBUG_LEAK=yes GST_GC=yes GST_DEBUG=pyt*:4 PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`  python dad/gstreamer/leveller.py /home/thomas/gst/media/small/south.mp3 

in output, source refcounting looks suspicious, so look for:
/ref.*uridecodebin0>

- figure out why overall position starts counting up from 0 to 10, then when
the mix starts, resets to 0, then after the mix, goes back to where it
should have been.

- check the mix from
  spears - slave 4 u to lemonheads - down about it to jlo-play (volumes)

- check mix from
  morphine - (my biggest fear) with dc - so good

- check mix from
  possum dixon - pharmaceutical itch to beyonce - crazy in love (too soft)

- check mix from
  tracy chapman - revolution to elbow - mexican standoff (second too soft)

- check mix
  embrace - waterfall to national - geese of beverly road (nice)

- mix between TLC - Switch and Grant Lee Buffalo - Mockingbirds sounds off - GLB too loud and too long a mix while TLC still singing.

- mix between Pet Shop Boys - Let's make lots of money with YYY's - Heads will roll (first too loud)

- My Bloody Valentine is really loud
- do minimal audio file analysis (as fast as possible):
	- whether it's an audio file
	- duration
	- samplerate
	- codec
	- codec properties
		- bitrate/quality
		- vorbis
			- version
			- encoder
			- nominal bitrate
			- upper bitrate
			- lower bitrate
			- average bitrate
	- tags/metadata
		- extended-comment

- make a start selecter method, and a callback, so that the couchdb one
  can connect and prime its track list
- probably same for actually getting tracks to play

 * rename trackmix to slice ?
 * find better name for slice, since it is a python keyword

- python examples/jukebox.py -g --selecter=dadcouch.selecter.couch:help
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'option_parser_class'
  Instead, make it list classes in that module

- don't fail on an empty or non-existing category

- create dad/base/track which groups the TrackController and base class for view and model
