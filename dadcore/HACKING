Flow
----
- player .setup()
  - creates JukeboxSource with scheduler
    - __init__ connects to scheduled signal
  - tells the jukebox to .work() in setup
  - jukebox.work() notices we don't have enough time left (we started at 0)
  - asks scheduler to .schedule()
  - scheduler asks selecter to select() a track
  - selecter reloads, get files from pickle, selectes, does a get(), and
    returns a track
  - scheduler adds the track
  - scheduler ._process() will wait for 2 added tracks before actually
    scheduling, and emitting the scheduled signal

Testing
-------
- selecter:
  python dad/common/selecter.py -h
  By default, selects from tracks.pickle
- example jukebox:
  - simple playlist:
  - couch-based:
  python examples/jukebox.py -g --selecter=dadcouch.selecter.couch.CouchSelecter:help
  python examples/jukebox.py -g --selecter=dadcouch.selecter.couch.CouchSelecter:user=thomas
